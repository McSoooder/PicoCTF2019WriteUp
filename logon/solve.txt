Login as logon on: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21895
Looking at the source at the landing page nothing interesting seems to help us so time for experimenting.
Entering the username "logon" and logging in with an empty password field logs us in but shows us a page
with the text "No flag for you" :(
Checking the source again, nothing special. 
So next up is looking at what is sent, when logging in the request header shows us the cookie that has an
Admin field with value "False". So by editing that request with that flag set to True instead gives us a
response with the flag:
