After taking a wild guess and once again looking at the metadata of the PNG file, no flag were to be found.
So I assumed that the flag was hidden using some kind of steganography. Steganography is a practice where you 
combine files to hide messages, in a way similar to encryption. With images it can be done in multiple ways.
Different images can for example be color coded (RGB) and combined to show a completely different image.

Messages can also be hidden in the bits of the image. Each pixel in the image are represented with a byte
(00000000). Changing the byte will change the image content (the colors) of course, but just changing
the last bit in each byte will not change the image judging from the naked eye. This is called Least 
Significant Bit Steganography. So each pixel houses one bit of the hidden message, in addition this can be
combined with a secret key aswell. Anyway, we don't have a secret key but there are a bunch of online tools
which will hide or check for hidden messages using this method. Uploading our PNG image to such a tool gives
us a flag:
 
picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}
