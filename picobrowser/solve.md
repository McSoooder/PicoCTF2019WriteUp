Coming onto the site we obviously have to try the big green button! The button results in an error:
*You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0... *

Awesome, so we probably have to change the user agent in our request header to 'picobrowser'. Let's try
editing the header and resending. 
It worked, the flag is ours:
**picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_6b1d92d7}**
