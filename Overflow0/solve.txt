Looking at the C source code the program will open the flag.txt file and read the flag into a char array.
The program will then define a signal handler function for segmentation fault signals which prints the flag.
This is the function we want to run.
In the main function, the function vuln takes the first program argument and reads into a buffer of size 128
bytes. Though, before running the strcpy no size check is done for the argument so if the argument is larger
than the buffer size there will be a segmentation fault. This way we can run the segmentation fault handler
function that prints the flag. So running the program with an argument of larger size than 128 bytes makes
the program output the flag:
picoCTF{3asY_P3a5y4a888b8e}
