The name is an obvious reference to wireshark so let's try open the PCAP (Packet CAPture?) file with wireshark.
After opening we see a bunch of captured packets. This is all too much to manually check each package so
perhaps the hints can give us some more info?
"What is a stream?"

So reading up on Wireshark on their official site we find this:
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAdvFollowStreamSection.html
instruction on how to watch the content of each stream. So when we start checking different streams we stumble
upon the flag:
