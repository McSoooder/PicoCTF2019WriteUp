Judging from the format, the flag have been encrypted with coordinates. So copying them and pasting into 
Google Maps to find out what country they are in was my first guess. Although up until the first underscore
it didn't make any sense, so I restarted and replaced the coordinates in the flag with the first letter
of the town it was from and it worked:
picoCTF{KODIAK_ALASKA}
