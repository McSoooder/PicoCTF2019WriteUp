The name is hinting to file extentions. Simply running a
"cat flag.txt"
gives us a bunch of nonesense. Perhaps we can find the true file type by running:
"file flag.txt"
Which tells us the file contains PNG image data. Let's rename the file with a .png extention:
"cp flag.txt flag.png"
And voila
"xdg-open flag.png"
