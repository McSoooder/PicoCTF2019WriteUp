As the name references to client side again we should find something useful in the inspector.
There is a script tag in the HTML with a long JS string. So I copy this string and paste it into my own
JavaScript-file and format it into more readable code. You can find the script in this folder.

There are alot of weird references in the script and it's not too obvious what is going on. I open
a console on the web page to access the local variables so I can print its values. The function named
_0x4b5b() takes an index argument and returns the value in the defined list at the start.
The list contains parts of the flag along with different functions, properties and objects known in JS.
This makes the flag quite easy do figure out:

picoCTF{not_this_again_055670}
