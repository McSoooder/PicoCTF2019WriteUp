Going to the challenges directory there are a bunch of directories with supposedly alot of files in each
directory. What we need is to run grep in a recursive mode so we can search through all directories and
their files for one expression. Looking at the manual page for grep:
"man grep
we can find the -r flag which enables the recursive option, great!

Running grep:
"grep -r picoCTF"
find us the flag in files3/file5:
picoCTF{grep_r_to_find_this_ee829ae6}
