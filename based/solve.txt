When we connect to the challenge using netcat we are prompted with a few binary numbers and we are asked
for the word which the numbers represent. To avoid slow manual calculation we only have 45 seconds to give
it to them. So I wrote a simple binary-to-ascii converting script that solved it for me. And another one
for the following octagonal string and for the hex string. I hope the scripts are self-explaining enough.
