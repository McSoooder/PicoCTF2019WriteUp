"What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases."
It does look like something base64-encoded. To check we can try to decode it using bash base64 function with 
the --decode option:
echo 'bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1' | base64 --decode
which gives us a string which seems alot like a flag:
picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
