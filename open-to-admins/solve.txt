This is a story all about how I over-engineered a CTF-challenge called Open-to-admins.
Now, a perfectly normal person would start off just like me and notice the bold text in the description
of "admin" and "time" and the hint referencing to cookies. The next logical step would be to set
a cookie value "admin" to True (as I did) and then a value "time" to 1400 (as I did not) like the 
description said...

Me on the other hand would start experimenting with DateTime formats, cookie expiry dates and search for
cookie tutorials on the web before trying to set the value simply to "1400" and getting the flag:

picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_2e8d3883}
