Judging from the table we have a Vigen√©re cipher with the key SOLVECRYPTO and the cipher UFJKXQZQUNB.
For each letter in the key, find that column and find the corresponding letter in the cipher and read 
what row it's on to get the plaintexts letter. Reversing the encryption where (key[i],plaintext[i])=cipher[i].
In the end, it gets us:
