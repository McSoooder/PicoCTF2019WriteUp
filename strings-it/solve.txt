Strings is a command for getting all the readable strings from a file. Running it gives us a ton of strings
which doesn't really help. Although if we run strings on the file and saves the output into a file:
"strings strings => stringar"
Then we can run grep in the output file for an expression:
"grep -e '\picoCTF' stringar"
Which gives us the flag:
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_0690b2a5}
