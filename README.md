# PicoCTF2019WriteUp
<https://www.picoctf.org/>
For learning purposes I am writing my own write-up of PicoCTF2019. I am solving all challenges without googling any answers, 
methods or tips. My goal is to complete all challenges by learning about the actual concept and figuring out my own way of 
finding the flags and also learning Python by writing small scripts wherever I see fit. 
This is my first CTF, any tips are welcome.

Each folder represents a challenge of the same name. In that folder are any files provided by the challenge along with any
possible script or other file I used to solve the challenge. When I complete a challenge I add a solve.txt file in that 
folder with a description of the concept I learned about and how I figured it out and finish with the flag.
