Just like how the ROT13 cipher were deciphered we can use the tr command to translate the characters into
another character interval. Since we don't know the number of rotations done we can brute force it:
tr 'a-z' 'b-za-b'
tr 'a-z 'c-za-c'
until we reach the correct one:
tr 'a-z 'e-za-e'
and it gives us what we need for the flag:
picoCTF{crossingtherubiconvyfzxekt}
