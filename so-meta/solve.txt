The challenge name is hinting at the flag is in the image metadata, so we need to extract the metadata.

The quick way:
	Run strings on the image:
	"strings pico_img.png"
	and the flag will be on the second to last row.

The more proper(?) way:
	Use a more specialized tool like exiftool and simply list the file metadata by running:
	"exiftool pico_img.png"
	The flag will be listed as value to the Artist key:

picoCTF{s0_m3ta_3d6ced35}
